        "explain": " Lactometer is a device used to measure the spe-\ncific gravity, and therefore the richness, of milk. It is\nbased on law of floatation which states that when a\nsolid is immersed in a liquid, it is subject to upward\nthrust equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by\nthe body and acting in upward direction. It is useful\nfor testing the purity of milk.\n128.\n "
