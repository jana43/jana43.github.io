At latitudes nearer the Equator, the\ninertia produced by Earth\u2019s rotation is stronger than\nat polar latitudes. This counteracts the Earth\u2019s gravity\nto a small degree \u2013 up to a maximum of 0.3% at the\nEquator \u2013 reducing the downward acceleration of\nfalling objects. The second major reason for the\nPHYSICAL Gdifference in gravity at different latitudes is that the\nEarth\u2019s equatorial bulge (itself also caused by inertia)\ncauses objects at the Equator to be farther from the\nplanet\u2019s centre than objects at the poles. Because\nthe force due to gravitational attraction between two\nbodies (the Earth and the object being weighed) varies\ninversely with the square of the distance between\nthem, an object at the Equator experiences a weaker\ngravitational pull than an object at the poles.\n43.\n "
